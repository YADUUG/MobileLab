        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Neurological disorders are diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system, affecting the brain, spinal cord, nerves, nerve roots, autonomic nervous system, and muscles. These disorders include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Epilepsy</li>
            <li>Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias</li>
            <li>Cerebrovascular diseases including stroke</li>
            <li>Migraine and other headache disorders</li>
            <li>Multiple sclerosis</li>
            <li>Parkinson’s disease</li>
            <li>Neuroinfections</li>
            <li>Brain tumors</li>
            <li>Traumatic disorders of the nervous system due to head trauma</li>
            <li>Neurological disorders as a result of malnutrition</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
        <p>Currently, neurological examinations involve a range of manual and observational techniques conducted by trained medical professionals. Common methods include assessing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reflexes</li>
            <li>Muscle strength</li>
            <li>Coordination</li>
            <li>Cognitive function</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, these traditional methods can be time-consuming, expensive, and may not always provide real-time insights into a patient's neurological condition.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="my-solution">
        <h2>Our Solution: NeuraBlink</h2>
        <p>Using computer vision and AI technology, particularly the Mediapipe library, NeuraBlink monitors and analyzes hand movements in real-time. The system detects and records hand movements, such as finger taps, and provides relevant data for neurological examination tests.</p>
        <p>The process involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Capturing video input</li>
            <li>Processing it using AI models to recognize hand landmarks</li>
            <li>Interpreting the movements to gather information about a user's motor skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The collected data, including tap counts, speed, and distances, can be valuable for neurological assessments.</p>

    <section class="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>NeuraBlink serves as an efficient platform for diagnosing various neurological disorders. Unlike traditional methods that require writing for diagnosis, NeuraBlink is beneficial for individuals who are not capable of reading and writing.</p>
        <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients suffered due to the lack of proper diagnosis. NeuraBlink can serve as a contact-free detection tool for any future pandemics, with minor modifications.</p>
        <p>In practical scenarios, individuals from villages often travel to nearby metro cities for expert opinions from MD doctors. This diagnosis tool helps doctors accurately analyze many patients in a limited time frame, providing a complete pipeline for correct diagnosis, including finger taps, hand flip movements, eye movements, and more.</p>
